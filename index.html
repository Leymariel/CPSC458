                <h3>Welp food review</h3>
                <p>Over the course of a few months I built an interactive platform to allow foodies to 
                    interact with their favorite institutions and find new places eat. The platform was 
                    build using python flask along with a cloud hosted SQL database which kept track 
                    of user and business logins, reviews images and more. The objective of this project 
                    was for me to expand my knowledge of web design as well as improve my skills using 
                    relational databases and create a product that could be deployed for commercial use. </p>

                <h3>AI code commenter extension for VSCode</h3>
                <p>The latest of my projects was quite quick to build but was by far one of the most fun 
                    to develop. The project made use of the openAI GPT-3.5 turbo model that would take 
                    in a block of code, parse for functions and return a standardardized comment structure 
                    including basic function, parameters, return type right above the function. The project 
                    is still being developped to improve the quality and consistency of comments.

                <h3>Algorithmic Trading</h3>
                <p>The algorithmic trading project is a program I have been working on for a few months now.
                    The program is designed to take in stock data which are used to compute numerous metrics such as 
                    garman klass volatility, rsi and macd to classify stocks into clusters based on similar performance.
                    The algorithm creates an optimized portfolio for each month to assist a user on making 
                    stock market investments. The project served as a fun way of looking into the intricacies 
                    and volatility of the stock market and how to use data to make informed decisions.
